# Dissecting the stdlib

Hello! This repo contains the IntelliJ project that I use to present my talk, "Dissecting the stdlib."

>

### To Do/Ideas
- Version that has *Before/After* as code + code regions/comments.
- Version that has bytecode in the comments.

### 08 Oct 2018
Currently, the file exists as the code in its final state, after any changes I make during the talk.
There are also none of the `main()` methods ATM.

### Talk Recordings
